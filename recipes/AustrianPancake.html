    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons margarine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt and sugar. Pour in milk, eggs and cream, and stir into a
            smooth batter. Meanwhile, melt margarine in a cast iron skillet. Pour the batter over the melted margarine.
        </li>
        <li>Place the skillet in the oven, and bake for 35 minutes. The pancake will rise to form a bubble in the
            middle. Remove from the oven, and let cool until the pancake sets, or goes down. Cut into pieces, serve with
            maple syrup and enjoy!</li>
